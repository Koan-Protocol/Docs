Koanprotocl a concentrated liquidity DEX built to align trader needs with liquidity provider incentives. Our goal is to create a capital-efficient and sustainable decentralized finance ecosystem that benefits all participants.

#### Key features

1. Concentrated Liquidity: We've built Koan with a concentrated liquidity model, empowering liquidity providers to allocate their capital within specific price ranges. This approach is significantly more capital-efficient than traditional DEX models, leading to higher returns for LPs and lower slippage for traders.
2. x(3,3) Tokenomics: At the core of our governance and incentive structure is the powerful x(3,3) tokenomics model. Inspired by Andre Cronje, this system is designed to reward long-term holders and governance participants, creating a robust, community-driven protocol.
3. Integrated Gaming Protocol: We've included a number of gaming features to give our platform an additional dimension. These entertaining and captivating protocols, which range from lotteries to prediction markets, give community members more chances to take part and win.
4. Additionally, we are developing a significant project that will alter your perspective on decentralised leverage trading. Keep an eye out.

KoanProtocol aims to become a major hub for liquidity and community by combining capital-efficient trading, incentives that are aligned, and engaging features.
